**_ FILE STRUCTURE _**

`main.py` file manages the logic

`database_helper.py` creates functions that abstract database operations

`test_main.py` contains unit tests

**_ HOW TO RUN _**

simply run `python main.py` in the terminal
make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the files

**_ CODE STYLE _**

- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions and `PascalCase` for classes
- Don't forget to put the "go back" option
- It is nice to use a break line after each option
- Check out helper functions
- If you do something cool, make it a funtion so others can use it too
- In summary, look at how the code is written and try to follow the same style

**_ BEST PRACTICES _**

- Break the code into smaller and testable functions
- Do not hardcode the values that are bound to change
- Update this doc if outdated

**_ RECOMMENDED TOOLS _**

These are some good python formatters:

```
  black <filename>
  pyright <filename>
  isort <filename>
```
